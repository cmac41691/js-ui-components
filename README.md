# JS UI Components

This project is a practice assignment based on The Odin Project's *Dynamic User Interface Interactions* lesson.

The goal is to build interactive UI components using **Vanilla JavaScript** ‚Äî specifically:
- A **dropdown menu** that toggles visibility on click
- An **image carousel** with manual and automatic navigation

No external libraries or frameworks are used. This is a foundational exercise in **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and building accessible UI components with clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dropdown Menu**
  - Click toggle with outside-click close
  - Accessible ARIA attributes
- **Image Carousel**
  - Previous/Next button navigation
  - **Bounded mode** (navigation stops at first/last slide, buttons disable appropriately)
  - Dot indicators with click and keyboard support
  - Start/Pause toggle for autoplay
  - Hover pause + resume
  - Keyboard arrow navigation

## Status

üõ†Ô∏è Currently in development as a side project to reinforce frontend fundamentals while building toward backend specialization.
