# JS UI Components

This project is a practice assignment based on The Odin Project's *Dynamic User Interface Interactions* lesson.

The goal is to build interactive UI components using **Vanilla JavaScript** ‚Äî specifically:
- A **drop-down menu** that toggles visibility on click
- An **image carousel** that cycles through slides

No external libraries or frameworks are used. This is a foundational exercise in **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**, done with clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Dropdown menu with click toggle
- Image carousel with manual slide navigation
- Semantic HTML and modular JS structure

## Status

üõ†Ô∏è Currently in development as a side project to reinforce frontend fundamentals while building toward backend specialization.

## Progress Log
